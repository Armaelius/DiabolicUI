This is a custom Diablo III styled user interface for World of Warcraft, put into a single addon that works in WotLK, Cata, MoP, WoD and Legion! 

It features both custom artwork and artworkbased on my own screenshots from Diablo 3. It's written from scratch, has no dependencies, needs no configuration or setup, and is made to function as-is straight out of the box. 

It's frequently tested on Warmane's WotLK-, Cata- and MoP clients, as well as retail WoD and the Legion beta realms. 


## How to install

Download and unzip it, navigate into the "DiabolicUI-master" folder, and move the folder named just "DiabolicUI" to your [i]\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\[/i] directory. It's important that you move the correct folder, or the game won't find the addon! 

Also, make sure the game is closed when moving new files into the addon directory as it is unable to discover new files when it's already running. And remember to check the "load out of date addons" checkbox in the addon listing on the character selection screen, or the game won't load the addon.


## Buy me a beer

Making stuff like this takes a boatload of time and effort. I do it because I love doing it, because I believe that it makes the game better. But still, a lot of hours is put into it. 

It is in no way required, since my addons always has been and always will be free and fully available to everybody without restrictions. But if you truly wish to support my hard work, a donation goes a long way! Because nothing is quite as motivating as beer money! :D
