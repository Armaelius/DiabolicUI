This is a custom Diablo III styled user interface for World of Warcraft, put into a single addon that works in WotLK, Cata, MoP, WoD and Legion!

It features both custom artwork and artwork based on my own screenshots from Diablo III. It's written from scratch, has no dependencies, needs no configuration or setup, and is made to function as-is straight out of the box.


## How to install

If you're familiar with git, simply clone the repository to a folder named **DiabolicUI** inside your World of Warcraft addons folder. If not, and you need to do this manually, then download and unzip it to your `World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\` directory. Rename the folder from **DiabolicUI-master** to just **DiabolicUI**, or the game won't find it. Also, make sure the game is closed when moving new files into the addon directory as it is unable to discover new files when it's already running.
